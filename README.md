# CZ3006: Net Centric Computing (Assignments)

This repository consists of 2 main projects as specified below in light of AY19/20 Semester 2 course changes due to the COVID-19 outbreak.

### Lab 4 Assignment: Analyzing Network Traffic Log Data using Python

Essentially answer a series of questions based on the SFLOW traffic log data that was provided.

Refer to `notebooks/lab4_notebook.ipynb`

Questions include:
* List the top 5 talkers
* List the top 5 listeners
* List the percentage proportion of UDP and TCP protocols
* List the top 5 application protocols
* Determine the Traffic Intensity
* List the top 5 communication pairs
* Visualize the communication between different IP host

### Assignment 1

Plot the channel utilization of slotted ALOHA, pure ALOHA, 1-persistent CSMA and p-persistent CSMA to compare them against each other.
The equations used to plot these graphs are based on the Kleinrock-Tobagi paper "Packet Switching in Radio Channels: Part I-Carrier Sense Multiple-Access Modes and Their Throughput-Delay Characteristics".
